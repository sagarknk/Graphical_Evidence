# Graphical Evidence

This repository contains code to implement our proposed technique [1] to compute marginal likelihood in Gaussian graphical models under four different priors on the precision matirx:
1. Bayesian graphical lasso (BGL)
2. Graphical horseshoe (GHS)
3. Wishart and
4. G-Wishart (including the case when precision matrix in banded)

More detailed instructions are within the README.txt files of the respective directories. In order to reproduce results of Table 7, the required protein expression data is provided in the folder Protein_Data.
